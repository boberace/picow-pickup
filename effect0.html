				Scope Tuner: 
				Each string has its own scope tuner.
				Tune the string to slow the wave down from moving left or right.
				The slower it is moving left to right the more in tune.
				The shape of the wave does not matter.
				Compare it to an instrument tuner to get an idea of how much to slow down.
				It will never stop moving back and forth as the string pitch fluctuates minute amounts.
				This can give an indication of how precise (not necessarily accurate) your instrument tuner is.
				Try to see how far you can tune your instrument while keeping inside the "tuned" area of the instrument tuner.
				Notice how fast and slow the Scope Tuner moves.  It is extremely precise (not necessarily accurate)
